1. choose random image
2. resize image to 320x240
3. convert to grayscale
4. choose random window of size 64x64
5. moove the corners from -16 to 16
6. compute homography H
7. compute inverse homography H^-1 and apply to image to get warped image
8. combine sample from original and warped image to get 2-channel tensor

training data:
1. generate images on the fly
